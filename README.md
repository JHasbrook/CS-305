Artemis Financial was the client in question. The company was looking for enhanced security measures within their software systems. They aimed to address vulnerabilities that could potentially expose sensitive financial data to unauthorized access or attacks. The primary issue they wanted to tackle was ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of their data through robust software security practices.

I feel that I performed well at assessing the company's vulnerabilities and integrating the SHA-256 cryptography techniques. This helped ensure data inegrity and maintained a secure authentication process. 

Secure coding is important for protecting software against potential vulnerabilities and threats, by enhancing safety and data privacy. Being a financial institution, it is important to protect the data of clients that use the company's services. This security adds a layer of client trust and ensures the company meets regulations put in place.

I increased the security of the company's software by conducting dependency checks and implementing secure communications with encryption. Secure communication was also ensured by verifying secure configurations like the RestController.

In the future, I would use automated vulnerability assessment tools like OWASP for dynamic analysis and SonarQube for static code analysis. These tools can help in identifying vulnerabilities more efficiently. They can also assist in deciding on appropriate mitigation techniques based on the severity and impact of the detected vulnerabilities.

To ensure the code and the application were functional, I performed many rigorous test along with the security assessment. I tried mitigating vulnerabilities by limiting the errors and bugs that existed in the code base, and when running the software. After refactoring the code, I used the flow chart to again assess the code manually and make sure there were no new aparent vulnerabilites. 

In the future, I would use a static testing tool to assess the security over manually going through the code and possibly missing vulnerabilites that a tool could have picked up. I would use SHA-256 in future projects to improve the security and I would also continue to follow the secure guidelines shown throughout the vulnerability flowchart assessment.

I might show future employers a couple things from this assignment. I would firstly show the demonstration of my grasp on secure coding practices. I would also show them the documentation for a comprehensive security assessment that shows the vulnerabilities and the mitigation for each one.
